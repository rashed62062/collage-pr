## ⚛️ React Concepts Used

The project leverages a range of React fundamental concepts, including:

- **Components**: Modular and reusable components structure.
- **State Management**: Managing local component states with `useState`.
- **Effect Hook**: Using `useEffect` for data fetching and side effects.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying different UI elements based on state conditions.
- **Event Handling**: Handling user interactions like clicks on buttons to add/remove items.

## 💾 Data Handling and Management

- **📦 Local Storage**: Used to store the Cart and Wishlist data persistently across sessions. This helps in retaining user selections and preferences.
- **🌍 Context API**: For global state management, enabling easy access to shared state across components without the need for prop drilling.

## Features

1. **🛒 Add to Cart and Wishlist**: Users can add gadgets to their Cart and Wishlist, with duplicate checks to avoid redundancy.
2. **🔄 Real-Time Updates**: Cart and Wishlist item counts update dynamically in the navbar as items are added or removed.
3. **📊 Sorting Functionality**: Users can sort Cart items by price, making it easier to view high-value items.
4. **💳 Purchase Modal with Summary**: A detailed modal appears when a purchase is initiated, showing the total cost and thanking the user.
5. **💾 Persistent Storage**: Cart and Wishlist data is saved in local storage, allowing users to resume where they left off on return visits.
